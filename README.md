## ðŸ“Œ Overview

This toolkit includes 3 self-contained modules that let users interact with linear algebra concepts through real computation and visualization:

| Module | Description |
|--------|-------------|
|  **Linear Equation Solver** | Solves systems of linear equations using Gaussian Elimination and Gauss Jordan Elimination |
|  **Matrix Transformation Visualizer** | Visualizes how matrices transform vectors in 2D and 3D space |
|  **PCA Visualizer** | Performs Principal Component Analysis using eigen decomposition and SVD |
